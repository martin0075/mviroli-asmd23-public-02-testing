**Task 1**
This task involves using the Mockito feature to implement unit tests based on the TDD approach. 
Specifically, the goal is to reorganize the provided tests and possibly create new ones, making appropriate use of all types of test doubles: Mock, Spy, Dummy, and Stub. 
The file containing the implemented tests is located within the Reorganize package.
